# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase in software development. 
It provides a structured approach to gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements for a booking management system. 
The aim is to create a clear blueprint to guide the development process and ensure the system meets stakeholder expectations.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding, documenting, and organizing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. 
It is a crucial step in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it ensures that the software being built meets the business goals and user needs. 

During Requirement Analysis, developers and analysts gather functional and non-functional requirements, define clear use cases, and set acceptance criteria. 
This helps prevent misunderstandings, reduces errors, and guides the development team to build software that is efficient, scalable, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.
