# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on the Requirement Analysis phase in software development. 
It provides a structured approach to gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements for a booking management system. 
The aim is to create a clear blueprint to guide the development process and ensure the system meets stakeholder expectations.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. 

This process ensures that the software solution aligns with business objectives and user needs while minimizing risks and costly errors during development. Requirement Analysis helps answer the fundamental question: *“What exactly should the software do, and how should it behave?”*

Key activities include:

- **Requirement Elicitation:** Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and workshops.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Creating clear and structured documents, including functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Requirement Validation:** Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, complete, and feasible.
- **Use Case & Acceptance Criteria Definition:** Designing scenarios and conditions that the software must meet to be considered successful.

By performing thorough Requirement Analysis, development teams gain clarity, improve communication, and lay a solid foundation for building scalable, reliable, and high-quality software solutions.
